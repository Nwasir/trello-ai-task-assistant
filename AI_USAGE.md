## How AI Helped
1. Project Planning

AI helped outline the project milestones, breaking the work into manageable steps over 4 days.

Created a detailed plan.md with step-by-step tasks, from environment setup to submission, including optional enhancements.

Suggested the repository structure suitable for using uv and make while keeping the project organized.

2. Learning & Research

AI provided explanations on Hugging Face API, Trello API, and Streamlit integration.

Clarified best practices for using environment variables securely with .env and Streamlit secrets.

Guided troubleshooting during errors like API 403/401 and dependency conflicts.

3. Coding Assistance

Generated initial Python code snippets for:

Connecting to Hugging Face models for task generation.

Sending tasks automatically to Trello using API calls.

Streamlit UI components for input, buttons, and results display.

Helped refactor code to store AI-generated tasks in session state to avoid “generate a task before sending” errors.

Suggested splitting the code logically: app.py for main Streamlit app, helper functions for Trello, and .env for secrets.

4. Debugging & Optimization

AI suggested fixes for Hugging Face model loading and local inference errors.

Recommended smaller models (google/flan-t5-small) to reduce memory usage.

Provided solutions for dependency resolution issues with uv and PyTorch.

5. Documentation & Submission

Drafted README.md and internship-friendly README that clearly explained the project.

Helped write AI_usage.md itself to highlight AI’s role in the workflow.

Suggested content for Loom demo and cover letter to showcase the project effectively.

## Summary

AI was used as a coding assistant, planning guide, and debugging advisor throughout the project. It enabled faster prototyping, structured development, and high-quality documentation, which aligns with the internship requirements:

Deliver a working prototype.

Demonstrate practical AI implementation in a real business workflow.

Showcase problem-solving and solution-shipping capabilities
